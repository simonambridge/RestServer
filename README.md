##Use Case
A large bank wants to monitor its customer creditcard transactions to detect and deter fraud attempts. They want the ability to search and group transactions by credit card, period, merchant, credit card provider, amounts, status etc.

The client wants a REST API to return:  

- Identify all transactions tagged as fraudulent in the last minute/day/month/year.
- Identify all transactions tagged as fraudulent for a specific card.
- Report of transactions for a merchant on a specific day.
- Roll-up report of transactions by card and year.
- Search capability to search the entire transaction database by merchant, cc_no, amounts.
- The ratio of transaction success based on the first 6 digits of their credit card no.     
- The ratio of confirmed transactions against fraudulent transactions in the last minute.
- A moving ratio of approved transactions per minute, per hour.
- A count of approved transactions per minute, per hour.

##Performance SLAs:
- The client wants an assurance that the data model can handle 1,000 transactions a second with stable latencies. The client currently handles accounts for over 15000 merchants and hopes to grow to 50,000 in a year.

##Setup
DataStax Enterprise supplies built-in enterprise search functionality on Cassandra data that scales and performs in a way that meets the search requirements of modern Internet Enterprise applications. Using this search functionality will allow the volume of transactions to grow without a loss in performance. DSE Search also allows for live indexing for improved index throughput and reduced reader latency. More details about live indexing can be found here -  http://docs.datastax.com/en/datastax_enterprise/4.8/datastax_enterprise/srch/srchConfIncrIndexThruPut.html

We will need to start DSE in Analytics and Search mode - Analytics to allow us to use the integrated Spark feature, and Search mode to allow us to use the search functionalities that we need on top of Cassandra.

- (Optional) If you would like to access Cassandra Table using JDBC or ODBC with SparkSQL you will need to start the SparkSQL Thrift Server (more details are available here: http://docs.datastax.com/en/latest-dse/datastax_enterprise/spark/sparkSqlThriftServer.html). If you are are doing this on a laptop you may want to limit the resources the thrift server consumes.
  * `dse start-spark-sql-thriftserver --conf spark.cores.max=2`

##DataModel

We will need multiple tables to fulfill the above query patterns and workloads (de-normalization is a good thing with NoSQL databases!).

For testing purposes we will use a single DC with one node and RF=1. 
For production deployment, we recommend a multi-datacenter Active-Active HA setup across geographical regions with RF=3.
```
create keyspace if not exists rtfap WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '1' };
```

To create this keyspace and the tables described below, run the create schema script:
```
$ cqlsh
cqlsh> source 'creates_and_inserts.cql'
```
This creates the following tables:

- Table Transactions - main transactions table
We will create a Solr index on this tables to fulfill a bunch of flexible search needs as well.

- Table hourlyaggregates_bycc - hourly roll-up of transactions by credit card

- Table dailyaggregates_bycc - daily roll-up of transactions by credit card

- Table monthlyaggregates_bycc - monthly roll-up of transactions by credit card

- Table yearlyaggregates_bycc - yearly roll-up of transactions by credit card

- Table dailytxns_bymerchant - daily roll-up of transactions by merchant

- Table txn_count_min - track transactions in a rolling window for analytics

The create script also creates some sample data for example:

```
insert into rtfap.transactions (year, month, day, hour, min, txn_time, cc_no, amount, cc_provider, items, location, merchant, notes, status, txn_id, user_id, tags) VALUES ( 2016, 03, 09, 12, 30, '2016-03-09 12:30:00', '1234123412341237', 1500.0, 'AMEX', {'clothes':1500}, 'New York', 'Ann Taylor', 'frequent customer', 'Approved', '876302', 'caroline', {'HighValue'});
```

##Sample queries

We can now run CQL queries to look up all transactions for given cc_no. 
The Transactions table is primarily write-oriented - it's the destination table for the streamed transactions and used for searches.
The table has a primary key and clustering columns so a typical query would look like this:
```
SELECT * FROM rtfap.transactions WHERE cc_no='1234123412341234' and year=2016 and month=3 and day=9;
```
The roll-up tables can also be queried - for example transactions for each merchant by day use the dailytxns_bymerchant table.
The roll-up tables get populated using the Spark batch and streaming analytics jobs so they wont yet have any data in them.
```
SELECT * FROM rtfap.dailytxns_bymerchant where merchant='Nordstrom' and day=20160317;
```

##Searching Data in DSE

The above queries allow us to query on the partition key and some or all of the clustering columns in the table definition. To query more generically on the other columns we will use DSE Search to index and search our data. 

To do this we use the dsetool to create a Solr core based on the Transactions table. In a production environment we would only index the columns that we would want to query on (pre-requisite: run the CQL schema create script as described above to create the necessary tables).

By default, when you automatically generate resources, existing data is not re-indexed so that you can check and customize the resources before indexing. To override the default and reindex existing data, use the reindex=true option:

```
dsetool create_core rtfap.transactions generateResources=true reindex=true
```

To check that DSE Search is up and running sucessfully go to http://[DSE node]:8983/solr/

Now we can query our data in a number of ways. One is through cql using the solr_query column. The other is through a third party library like SolrJ which will interact with the search tool through ReST.

Below are the CQL Solr queries addressing some of the client requirements (&more) for searching the data in DSE:

Get counts (&records) of transactions faceted by merchant or cc_provider.
```
SELECT * FROM rtfap.transactions where solr_query='{"q":"*:*", "facet":{"field":"merchant"}}';
SELECT * FROM rtfap.transactions where solr_query='{"q":"*:*", "facet":{"field":"cc_provider"}}';
```

Get transactions by first 6 digits of cc_no (and perhaps filter query it further by the status!).
```
SELECT * FROM rtfap.transactions where solr_query='{"q":"cc_no: 123412*",  "fq":"status: Rejected"}';
```

Get all the transactions tagged as Fraudulent in the last day and last minute.
```
SELECT * FROM rtfap.transactions where solr_query = '{"q":"*:*", "fq":["txn_time:[NOW-1MINUTE TO *]", "tags:Fraudulent"]}';
SELECT * FROM rtfap.transactions where solr_query = '{"q":"*:*", "fq":["txn_time:[NOW-1YEAR TO *]", "tags:Fraudulent"]}';

```
As you can see from the above samples , full ad-hoc search on any transaction fields is possible including amounts, merchants etc.
We will use queries like this to build the ReST interface.

## Querying Data Using A ReST Web Interface

A ReSTful web interface provides an API for calling programs to query the data in Cassandra.
To use the web service, use the following urlâ€™s. These will return a json representation of the data using the ReST service.

The sample queries are served by a web service written in Java. The code for this web service is provided in the repo.
The web service adopts a framework that separates the web, service and data access layers into individual, easily maintainable components.

You'll need to install Maven to compile the code. As the root account use apt-get to install it:
```
$ apt-get install maven
```

Compile the code:

```
$ mvn clean compile
```

To start the web service use the command:
```
$ mvn jetty:run
```
To bind to a specific interface or port (other than localhost and the default of 8080) use:
```
$ mvn jetty:run -DcontactPoints=<server IP address> -Djetty.port=<port number>
```
For example - to run on a server with an IP of 10.0.0.4 and run the service on port 7001, and persist the web service after logging out use:
```
$ nohup mvn jetty:run -DcontactPoints=10.0.0.4 -Djetty.port=7001 &
```

At this point you will be able to run the solr queries shown below.

The queries demonstrate the use of both straightforward CQL and CQL-Solr. This can be seen in TransactionsDao.java:
- CQL queries bind the individual parameters passed from the web interface
- CQL-SOLR queries must bind the complete "where" clause as a single bind variable

## Analyzing data using DSE Spark Analytics

DSE provides integration with Spark out of the box. This allows for analysis of data in-place on the same cluster where the data is ingested with workload isolation and without the need to ETL the data. The data ingested in a Cassandra only (OLTP) data center is automatically replicated to a logical data center of Cassandra nodes also hosting Spark Workers.

This tight integration between Cassandra and Spark offers huge value in terms of significantly reduced ETL complexity (no data movement to different clusters) and thus reducing time to insight from your data through a much less complex "cohesive lambda architecture" .

###Streaming Analytics

The streaming analytics element of this application is made up of two parts:

* The transaction producer is a Scala app that generates random transactions and then places those transactions on a Kafka queue. 
* The transaction consumer, also written in Scala, is a Spark streaming job that (a) consumes the messages put on the Kafka queue and then (b) parses those messages, evalutes the transaction status and then writes them to the Datastax/Cassandra table.

Streaming analytics code can be found under the directory 'TransactionHandlers' (pre-requisite: run the CQL schema create script as described above to create the necessary tables).

Follow the installation and set up instructions [here:](https://github.com/simonambridge/RTFAP/tree/master/TransactionHandlers)

###Batch Analytics

Two Spark batch jobs have been included. 
* `run_rollupbymerchant.sh` provides a daily roll-up of all the transactions in the last day, by merchant. 
* `run_rollupbycc.sh` populates the hourly/daily/monthly/yearly aggregate tables by credit card, calculating the total_amount, avg_amount and total_count.

The roll up batch analytics code and submit scripts can be found under the directory 'RollUpReports' (pre-requisite: run the streaming analytics to populate the Transaction table with transaction data).

Follow the installation and set up instructions [here:](https://github.com/simonambridge/RTFAP/tree/master/RollUpReports)


###Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter notebook can be found at http://[DSE Host]:8084/notebooks/RTFAP%20Test%20Queries.ipynb


##Stress yaml

Running a cassandra-stress test with the appropriate YAML profile for the table helps show how DSE will perform in terms of latency and throughput for writes and reads to/from the system.

The stress YAML files are uploaded to this [directory](https://github.com/simonambridge/RTFAP/tree/master/stress_yamls).

The YAML tries to mirror real data, for example: month is a value between 1 and 12, year is between 2010 and 2016, credit card number is 16 characters in length, etc

You can read more about stress testing a data model here
http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/improved-cassandra-2-1-stress-tool-benchmark-any-schema
http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.1/cassandra/tools/toolsCStress_t.html

An example of running the stress tool is below using [txn_by_cc_stress.yaml](https://github.com/simonambridge/RTFAP/blob/master/stress_yamls/txn_by_cc_stress.yaml):

For inserts
```
cassandra-stress user profile=./txn_by_cc_stress.yaml ops\(insert=1\) cl=LOCAL_ONE n=100000 -rate auto -node 10.0.0.5

Results:
